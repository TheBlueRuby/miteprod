# Ultramite Story 1 Draft

---

In Ultramite universe basically Earth is canon but not the main planet  
and Mites are like robots  
and on another planet  
and so one of the Mites trying to join Mite R&D built a robot for his entry project which would become Ultramite 1.0
and the Mite got accepted
and then later they made Ultramite 2.0 which was less scuffed to protect Mitopia (i wasn't that inventive with the name of the city)  
and then they realised there was nothing to protect mitopia from  
because the only non-junkyard part of the planet was Mitopia itself  
and so then at some point an evil mite called Etim appeared (again, not that creative)  
then Etim used a computer virus to infect the mites in Mitopia  
because they are robots  
then the first Ultramite 3.0 is built (the current Ultramite model)  
its id is Blue8  
and so Blue8 goes to the wasteland to stop Etim  
and a Mite joins Blue8  
and they go to the wasteland  
and then failed projects start to awaken thanks to the virus  
then they attack Ultramite  
so Ultramite has to attack them  
and from the floor Ultramite grabs a plasma cannon

and Ultramite has to metroid-style find Etim's lair  
which is an old server room  
and destroy the virus' organic base  
then the virus making program will stop  
then because Ultramite has no orders to attack Etim Blue8 must leave
